# VPNLTools
A repository for MATLAB utilites, lab computing environment utilities, and 
data analysis tools.

#### `matlab_utils/`

#### `lab_utils/`

#### `examples/`

### Best Practices
1. Prefixes should be lowercase, followed by an underscore and the function name in camelCase. `<prefix>_<functionName>.m`
2. Commit messages should be written in the present tense. "Adds ___" instead of "Added ____"
3. Develop on separate branches, merge to master only after code review by at least one other lab member
4. Add your initials and Month + Year to the function description.
